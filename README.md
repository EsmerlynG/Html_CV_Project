- Working with sections, headings, and paragraphs
- Creating clickable links and email contacts
- Basic HTML formatting and organization

## Key Features & Code Examples
### Semantic HTML Structure
Used proper HTML5 semantic elements to organize content:

    <p>
        <font size="3"><b>skills</b></font>
        <hr>
    </p>
    <font size="">Python, Github</font>
</section>
```

### Clickable Contact Links
Implemented proper anchor tags for external links and email contact:
```html
<!-- Email link -->
<a href="mailto:wrkgarabito@gmail.com">wrkgarabito@gmail.com</a>
<!-- Social media links that open in new tabs -->
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/esmerlyn-garabito" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a> | 
<a href="https://github.com/EsmerlynG" target="_blank">GitHub</a>
```

### Professional Experience Layout
Organized work experience using lists for better readability:
```html
<section id="experience">
    <p><font size="3"><b>Experience</b></font></p>
    <hr>
    <ul>
        <li>Led a 12-person DevOps team to design and deploy a full-stack website for Maxx Energy.</li>
        <li>Managed Agile ceremonies including daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives.</li>
